Token Giver is a decentralized application designed to revolutionize charity and fundraising. With Token Giver, users can create and manage campaigns by minting unique campaign NFTs, which have Token Bound Accounts (TBA) deployed on them automatically. This enables seamless and secure donations using STRK tokens. This project leverages the power of Next.js, StarknetJs, Starknet TBA SDK, and smart contracts written in Cairo to provide a robust and user-friendly platform..

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### The Problem

Traditional fundraising and charity methods often suffer from:

- A lack of transparency.
- High operational costs.
- Slow fund transfers.

These challenges lead to delays and diminished trust, reducing the overall impact of charitable activities.

### The Solution

Token Giver leverages blockchain technology and ERC6551 token-bound accounts to address these challenges by providing:

- Transparency: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain for an immutable, publicly accessible record.

- Efficiency: Direct donations with lower transaction fees ensure that contributions go further.

- Security: Blockchain's inherent security guarantees safe and trustable fund transfers.

Token Giver transforms how donations are managed, making charitable campaigns more trustworthy and impactful.

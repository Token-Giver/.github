Token Giver is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that empowers individuals, groups, and organizations to raise funds for a wide range of causes. Users can create personalized fundraising campaigns by sharing their stories, setting financial goals, and collecting donations from supporters. Each campaign is represented as an NFT with a Token Bound Account (TBA), enabling donors to send tokens directly to the campaign securely and transparently.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### The Problem

Traditional fundraising and charity methods often suffer from:

- A lack of transparency.
- High operational costs.
- Slow fund transfers.

These challenges lead to delays and diminished trust, reducing the overall impact of charitable activities.

### The Solution

Token Giver leverages blockchain technology and ERC6551 token-bound accounts to address these challenges by providing:

- Transparency: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain for an immutable, publicly accessible record.

- Efficiency: Direct donations with lower transaction fees ensure that contributions go further.

- Security: Blockchain's inherent security guarantees safe and trustable fund transfers.

Token Giver transforms how donations are managed, making charitable campaigns more trustworthy and impactful.
